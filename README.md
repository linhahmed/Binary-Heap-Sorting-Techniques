# Binary Heap & Sorting Techniques:

* INode: this interface will pose as a wrapper for any element in your tree/heap. (e.g. left childâ€™s index is 2 * index of the current node).

* IHeap: this interface will represent a binary tree. Your tree could represent the heap data structure. 
It could also represent the output tree of the heapsort, or any binary tree in general.

* ISort: this interface will represent the three sorting algorithms you will implement 
(heap sort, O(nlgn) Merge Sort, and O(n^2) Bubble Sort).
